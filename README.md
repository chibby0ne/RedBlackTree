##Red-Black binary search tree

###Definition
A red-black binary search tree is an interesting data structure.

Here you can see a graphical representation of it:

Every "Node" can contains generic data and have two children that are nodes themselves.
The left child has a lower value than the parent, le right child a greater.

The specific rules of red-black tree are:
* Every node has a color: red or black
* The root (a node without parent) is black
* Every leaf (a node without children) is black
* Both children of a black node are red.
* Both subtree of a node has the same number of black nodes.

###Features
They are really efficient to implements dictionaries and sets, especially if you can order the keys.
Those trees have auto-balancing systems so the maximum height is always limited to O(logN) where N is the number of nodes of the tree.
In this way lots of operation can be executed in O(logN) that is a very efficient value.

More precisely a red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2lg(n+1), an interesting proof of this lemma can be found at page. 309 of
